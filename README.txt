Basic Mechanics
------------------------------------
Rose from the Dead is a adventure/horror game where you must navigate your way through a world infested with the Rosen Dead,
people who have been turned into zombies by mutated roses. To get around these zombies, you must use a special UV flashlight that is able
to paralyze the Rosen Dead and stop them from moving. You must be careful however, as your flashlight has a limited battery life, and without
it you are defenseless against the undead.

Known Issues / Bugs
------------------------------------
The Following bugs are already well-known to the development team
and do not need to be reported on the Beta Survey.

Flashlight position does not update properly
  -This is a technical limitation of RPG Maker that we are working on fixing.
  
Performance Issues on lower-end machines
  -Due to current AI implementation the more populated maps can cause some lag
   on lower end computers.
